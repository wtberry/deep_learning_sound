# Song / Artist recognition using Deep Learning

Using python and LSTM/Transformer for song classification.
Following this tutorial for loading sound files to python [Getting Started with Audio Data Analysis using Deep Learning](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/audio-voice-processing-deep-learning/)

# Libraries
- TF
- [Librosa](https://librosa.github.io/):sound loading/preprocessing

# some noets
- Frequency and time domain(dimension?), imagine different sound waves for each frequencies, so 1 song should be a 2D data??

# Following the tutorial on jupyter noteobok for now
